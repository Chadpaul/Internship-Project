## Why I Started Ritotric Foundation

*I started Ritotric Foundation because i wanted people mainly youths who love sports around Uganda to get a chance to participate in tournaments that would allow them to build on their talents through continuous competitions.*


## Health Benefits
 *A lot of time and energy is required to play a sport. Some parent's may think this would distract student-athletes from schoolwork. Nevertheless, the opposite is true. Sports require memorization, repetition and learning â€” skill sets that are directly admissible to class work. Also, the resolution and goal-setting skills a sport requires can be conveyed to the classroom.*


## What the website is about
*Ritotric Foundation is about letting youths know the benefits and core values of doing sports. It will help change the lives of vulnerable children and young people who have not been given an equal chance to success. And to help develop young people mentally and physically by using the values of Respect, Enjoyment, Discipline, Teamwork and Sportsmanship.*
